# quarantine_corner
This is our project for DefHacks 2020: Quarantine Corner.

Our names are Preesha, Annie, Mabel, Rona, and Katarina, and we’re all grade 12 students from the Greater Toronto Area. In the fall we will begin our studies at the University of Waterloo and are majoring in computer science. 

We decided to make a google chrome extension that makes life in quarantine significantly easier by being your one stop shop to the date and time, your to do list, covid-19 updates, and ideas for keeping busy during quarantine. 

Each time you open a new window or tab you will get a new background image with a link to that day’s quarantine activity suggestion. This is meant to keep you busy, while learning some new skills and trying out new hobbies. 

We chose to create an extension over creating a website because an extension is so much more convenient. Instead of having to visit several web pages, the user can conveniently access all the information they need simply by opening a new window or tab!

The extension is written in html, css, and javascript while utilizing node js to extract covid data in real time. 

To install the extension, simply upload the folder on chrome’s extensions page using developer mode by clicking the “Load Unpacked” button.
